Xcryptobot is a simple experiment to learn and practice using Selenium and Jupyter. It was purely for educational purposes, and I ensured it followed ethical guidelines, respecting X rules and user privacy. No malicious intentions were involved, and it was meant solely to enhance my Python programming skills.
